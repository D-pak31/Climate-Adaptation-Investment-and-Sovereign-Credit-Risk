\# Climate Adaptation Investment and Sovereign Credit Risk



This repository contains the seminar project analyzing how climate adaptation investments affect sovereign credit risk using sovereign CDS spreads across 44 countries (2009–2023).



\## Project Overview

The study examines whether government spending on environmental protection reduces perceived sovereign default risk, while controlling for macroeconomic fundamentals, climate vulnerability, and institutional readiness.



\## Data

\- Sovereign 5-year CDS spreads (Refinitiv)

\- Environmental protection expenditure (IMF COFOG)

\- Macroeconomic variables (World Bank)

\- Climate vulnerability and readiness indices (ND-GAIN)

\- Disaster data (EM-DAT)

\## Data Availability

Due to data licensing restrictions and GitHub file size limits, raw and high-frequency CDS data (Refinitiv) and raw EM-DAT files are not included in this repository. The final regression-ready dataset used in all empirical analyses is provided to ensure reproducibility of results.


\## Methodology

\- Panel fixed-effects regressions

\- Event-study analysis around major climate disasters

\- Risk-based country classification using CDS quartiles
